UploadFile
class¶
You can define path operation function parameters to be of the type UploadFile
to receive files from the request.
You can import it directly from fastapi
:
from fastapi import UploadFile
fastapi.UploadFile
¶
UploadFile(file, *, size=None, filename=None, headers=None)
Bases: UploadFile
A file uploaded in a request.
Define it as a path operation function (or dependency) parameter.
If you are using a regular def
function, you can use the upload_file.file
attribute to access the raw standard Python file (blocking, not async), useful and
needed for non-async code.
Read more about it in the FastAPI docs for Request Files.
Example¶
from typing import Annotated
from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile
app = FastAPI()
@app.post("/files/")
async def create_file(file: Annotated[bytes, File()]):
return {"file_size": len(file)}
@app.post("/uploadfile/")
async def create_upload_file(file: UploadFile):
return {"filename": file.filename}
Source code in starlette/datastructures.py
def __init__(
self,
file: BinaryIO,
*,
size: int | None = None,
filename: str | None = None,
headers: Headers | None = None,
) -> None:
self.filename = filename
self.file = file
self.size = size
self.headers = headers or Headers()
# Capture max size from SpooledTemporaryFile if one is provided. This slightly speeds up future checks.
# Note 0 means unlimited mirroring SpooledTemporaryFile's __init__
self._max_mem_size = getattr(self.file, "_max_size", 0)
read
async
¶
read(size=-1)
Read some bytes from the file.
To be awaitable, compatible with async, this is run in threadpool.
| PARAMETER | DESCRIPTION |
|---|---|
size
|
The number of bytes to read from the file.
TYPE:
|
Source code in fastapi/datastructures.py
async def read(
self,
size: Annotated[
int,
Doc(
"""
The number of bytes to read from the file.
"""
),
] = -1,
) -> bytes:
"""
Read some bytes from the file.
To be awaitable, compatible with async, this is run in threadpool.
"""
return await super().read(size)
write
async
¶
write(data)
Write some bytes to the file.
You normally wouldn't use this from a file you read in a request.
To be awaitable, compatible with async, this is run in threadpool.
| PARAMETER | DESCRIPTION |
|---|---|
data
|
The bytes to write to the file.
TYPE:
|
Source code in fastapi/datastructures.py
async def write(
self,
data: Annotated[
bytes,
Doc(
"""
The bytes to write to the file.
"""
),
],
) -> None:
"""
Write some bytes to the file.
You normally wouldn't use this from a file you read in a request.
To be awaitable, compatible with async, this is run in threadpool.
"""
return await super().write(data)
seek
async
¶
seek(offset)
Move to a position in the file.
Any next read or write will be done from that position.
To be awaitable, compatible with async, this is run in threadpool.
| PARAMETER | DESCRIPTION |
|---|---|
offset
|
The position in bytes to seek to in the file.
TYPE:
|
Source code in fastapi/datastructures.py
async def seek(
self,
offset: Annotated[
int,
Doc(
"""
The position in bytes to seek to in the file.
"""
),
],
) -> None:
"""
Move to a position in the file.
Any next read or write will be done from that position.
To be awaitable, compatible with async, this is run in threadpool.
"""
return await super().seek(offset)
close
async
¶
close()
Close the file.
To be awaitable, compatible with async, this is run in threadpool.
Source code in fastapi/datastructures.py
async def close(self) -> None:
"""
Close the file.
To be awaitable, compatible with async, this is run in threadpool.
"""
return await super().close()
