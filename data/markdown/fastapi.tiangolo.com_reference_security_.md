Security Tools¶
When you need to declare dependencies with OAuth2 scopes you use Security()
.
But you still need to define what is the dependable, the callable that you pass as a parameter to Depends()
or Security()
.
There are multiple tools that you can use to create those dependables, and they get integrated into OpenAPI so they are shown in the automatic docs UI, they can be used by automatically generated clients and SDKs, etc.
You can import them from fastapi.security
:
from fastapi.security import (
APIKeyCookie,
APIKeyHeader,
APIKeyQuery,
HTTPAuthorizationCredentials,
HTTPBasic,
HTTPBasicCredentials,
HTTPBearer,
HTTPDigest,
OAuth2,
OAuth2AuthorizationCodeBearer,
OAuth2PasswordBearer,
OAuth2PasswordRequestForm,
OAuth2PasswordRequestFormStrict,
OpenIdConnect,
SecurityScopes,
)
Read more about them in the FastAPI docs about Security.
API Key Security Schemes¶
fastapi.security.APIKeyCookie
¶
APIKeyCookie(
*,
name,
scheme_name=None,
description=None,
auto_error=True
)
Bases: APIKeyBase
API key authentication using a cookie.
This defines the name of the cookie that should be provided in the request with the API key and integrates that into the OpenAPI documentation. It extracts the key value sent in the cookie automatically and provides it as the dependency result. But it doesn't define how to set that cookie.
Usage¶
Create an instance object and use that object as the dependency in Depends()
.
The dependency result will be a string containing the key value.
Example¶
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI
from fastapi.security import APIKeyCookie
app = FastAPI()
cookie_scheme = APIKeyCookie(name="session")
@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(session: str = Depends(cookie_scheme)):
return {"session": session}

HTTP Credentials¶
fastapi.security.HTTPAuthorizationCredentials
¶
Bases: BaseModel
The HTTP authorization credentials in the result of using HTTPBearer
or
HTTPDigest
in a dependency.
The HTTP authorization header value is split by the first space.
The first part is the scheme
, the second part is the credentials
.
For example, in an HTTP Bearer token scheme, the client will send a header like:
Authorization: Bearer deadbeef12346
In this case:
scheme
will have the value"Bearer"
credentials
will have the value"deadbeef12346"
fastapi.security.HTTPBasicCredentials
¶
Bases: BaseModel
The HTTP Basic credentials given as the result of using HTTPBasic
in a
dependency.
Read more about it in the FastAPI docs for HTTP Basic Auth.

challenge by default, as
it's probably the most common one.

OAuth2 Password Form¶
fastapi.security.OAuth2PasswordRequestForm
¶
OAuth2PasswordRequestForm(
*,
grant_type=None,
username,
password,
scope="",
client_id=None,
client_secret=None
)
This is a dependency class to collect the username
and password
as form data
for an OAuth2 password flow.
The OAuth2 specification dictates that for a password flow the data should be
collected using form data (instead of JSON) and that it should have the specific
fields username
and password
.
All the initialization parameters are extracted from the request.
Read more about it in the FastAPI docs for Simple OAuth2 with Password and Bearer.
Example¶
from typing import Annotated
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordRequestForm
app = FastAPI()
@app.post("/login")
def login(form_data: Annotated[OAuth2PasswordRequestForm, Depends()]):
data = {}
data["scopes"] = []
for scope in form_data.scopes:
data["scopes"].append(scope)
if form_data.client_id:
data["client_id"] = form_data.client_id
if form_data.client_secret:
data["client_secret"] = form_data.client_secret
return data
Note that for OAuth2 the scope items:read
is a single scope in an opaque string.
You could have custom internal logic to separate it by colon characters (:
) or
similar, and get the two parts items
and read
. Many applications do that to
group and organize permissions, you could do it as well in your application, just
know that it is application specific, it's not part of the specification.

grant_type
is optional.
