0.120.0 (2025-10-23)¶
There are no major nor breaking changes in this release. ☕️
The internal reference documentation now uses annotated_doc.Doc
instead of typing_extensions.Doc
, this adds a new (very small) dependency on annotated-doc
, a package made just to provide that Doc
documentation utility class.
I would expect typing_extensions.Doc
to be deprecated and then removed at some point from typing_extensions
, for that reason there's the new annotated-doc
micro-package. If you are curious about this, you can read more in the repo for annotated-doc
.
This new version 0.120.0
only contains that transition to the new home package for that utility class Doc
.

0.119.0 (2025-10-11)¶
FastAPI now (temporarily) supports both Pydantic v2 models and pydantic.v1
models at the same time in the same app, to make it easier for any FastAPI apps still using Pydantic v1 to gradually but quickly migrate to Pydantic v2.
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel as BaseModelV2
from pydantic.v1 import BaseModel
class Item(BaseModel):
name: str
description: str | None = None
class ItemV2(BaseModelV2):
title: str
summary: str | None = None
app = FastAPI()
@app.post("/items/", response_model=ItemV2)
def create_item(item: Item):
return {"title": item.name, "summary": item.description}
Adding this feature was a big effort with the main objective of making it easier for the few applications still stuck in Pydantic v1 to migrate to Pydantic v2.
And with this, support for Pydantic v1 is now deprecated and will be removed from FastAPI in a future version soon.
Note: have in mind that the Pydantic team already stopped supporting Pydantic v1 for recent versions of Python, starting with Python 3.14.
You can read in the docs more about how to Migrate from Pydantic v1 to Pydantic v2.

- ✨ Add support for
from pydantic.v1 import BaseModel
, mixed Pydantic v1 and v2 models in the same app. PR #14168 by @tiangolo.

0.118.0 (2025-09-29)¶
Fixes¶
- 🐛 Fix support for
StreamingResponse
s with dependencies withyield
orUploadFile
s, close after the response is done. PR #14099 by @tiangolo.
Before FastAPI 0.118.0, if you used a dependency with yield
, it would run the exit code after the path operation function returned but right before sending the response.
This change also meant that if you returned a StreamingResponse
, the exit code of the dependency with yield
would have been already run.
For example, if you had a database session in a dependency with yield
, the StreamingResponse
would not be able to use that session while streaming data because the session would have already been closed in the exit code after yield
.
This behavior was reverted in 0.118.0, to make the exit code after yield
be executed after the response is sent.
You can read more about it in the docs for Advanced Dependencies - Dependencies with yield
, HTTPException
, except
and Background Tasks. Including what you could do if you wanted to close a database session earlier, before returning the response to the client.

0.115.0 (2024-09-17)¶
Highlights¶
Now you can declare Query
, Header
, and Cookie
parameters with Pydantic models. 🎉
Query
Parameter Models¶
Use Pydantic models for Query
parameters:
from typing import Annotated, Literal
from fastapi import FastAPI, Query
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
app = FastAPI()
class FilterParams(BaseModel):
limit: int = Field(100, gt=0, le=100)
offset: int = Field(0, ge=0)
order_by: Literal["created_at", "updated_at"] = "created_at"
tags: list[str] = []
@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(filter_query: Annotated[FilterParams, Query()]):
return filter_query
Read the new docs: Query Parameter Models.
Header
Parameter Models¶
Use Pydantic models for Header
parameters:
from typing import Annotated
from fastapi import FastAPI, Header
from pydantic import BaseModel
app = FastAPI()
class CommonHeaders(BaseModel):
host: str
save_data: bool
if_modified_since: str | None = None
traceparent: str | None = None
x_tag: list[str] = []
@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(headers: Annotated[CommonHeaders, Header()]):
return headers
Read the new docs: Header Parameter Models.
Cookie
Parameter Models¶
Use Pydantic models for Cookie
parameters:
from typing import Annotated
from fastapi import Cookie, FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
app = FastAPI()
class Cookies(BaseModel):
session_id: str
fatebook_tracker: str | None = None
googall_tracker: str | None = None
@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(cookies: Annotated[Cookies, Cookie()]):
return cookies
Read the new docs: Cookie Parameter Models.
Forbid Extra Query (Cookie, Header) Parameters¶
Use Pydantic models to restrict extra values for Query
parameters (also applies to Header
and Cookie
parameters).
To achieve it, use Pydantic's model_config = {"extra": "forbid"}
:
from typing import Annotated, Literal
from fastapi import FastAPI, Query
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
app = FastAPI()
class FilterParams(BaseModel):
model_config = {"extra": "forbid"}
limit: int = Field(100, gt=0, le=100)
offset: int = Field(0, ge=0)
order_by: Literal["created_at", "updated_at"] = "created_at"
tags: list[str] = []
@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(filter_query: Annotated[FilterParams, Query()]):
return filter_query
This applies to Query
, Header
, and Cookie
parameters, read the new docs:

You can restrict form fields to only include those declared in a Pydantic model and forbid any extra field sent in the request using Pydantic's model_config = {"extra": "forbid"}
:
from typing import Annotated
from fastapi import FastAPI, Form
from pydantic import BaseModel
app = FastAPI()
class FormData(BaseModel):
username: str
password: str
model_config = {"extra": "forbid"}
@app.post("/login/")

0.112.0 (2024-08-02)¶
Breaking Changes¶
- ♻️ Add support for
pip install "fastapi[standard]"
with standard dependencies andpython -m fastapi
. PR #11935 by @tiangolo.
Summary¶
Install with:
pip install "fastapi[standard]"
Other Changes¶
- This adds support for calling the CLI as:
python -m fastapi
- And it upgrades
fastapi-cli[standard] >=0.0.5
.
Technical Details¶
Before this, fastapi
would include the standard dependencies, with Uvicorn and the fastapi-cli
, etc.
And fastapi-slim
would not include those standard dependencies.
Now fastapi
doesn't include those standard dependencies unless you install with pip install "fastapi[standard]"
.
Before, you would install pip install fastapi
, now you should include the standard
optional dependencies (unless you want to exclude one of those): pip install "fastapi[standard]"
.
This change is because having the standard optional dependencies installed by default was being inconvenient to several users, and having to install instead fastapi-slim
was not being a feasible solution.

0.110.0 (2024-02-24)¶
Breaking Changes¶
- 🐛 Fix unhandled growing memory for internal server errors, refactor dependencies with
yield
andexcept
to require raising again as in regular Python. PR #11191 by @tiangolo.- This is a breaking change (and only slightly) if you used dependencies with
yield
, usedexcept
in those dependencies, and didn't raise again. - This was reported internally by @rushilsrivastava as a memory leak when the server had unhandled exceptions that would produce internal server errors, the memory allocated before that point would not be released.
- Read the new docs: Dependencies with
yield
andexcept
.
- This is a breaking change (and only slightly) if you used dependencies with
In short, if you had dependencies that looked like:
def my_dep():
try:
yield
except SomeException:
pass
Now you need to make sure you raise again after except
, just as you would in regular Python:
def my_dep():
try:
yield
except SomeException:
raise

0.106.0 (2023-12-25)¶
Breaking Changes¶
Using resources from dependencies with yield
in background tasks is no longer supported.
This change is what supports the new features, read below. 🤓
Dependencies with yield
, HTTPException
and Background Tasks¶
Dependencies with yield
now can raise HTTPException
and other exceptions after yield
. 🎉
Read the new docs here: Dependencies with yield
and HTTPException
.
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI, HTTPException
from typing_extensions import Annotated
app = FastAPI()
data = {
"plumbus": {"description": "Freshly pickled plumbus", "owner": "Morty"},
"portal-gun": {"description": "Gun to create portals", "owner": "Rick"},
}
class OwnerError(Exception):
pass
def get_username():
try:
yield "Rick"
except OwnerError as e:
raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=f"Owner error: {e}")
@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def get_item(item_id: str, username: Annotated[str, Depends(get_username)]):
if item_id not in data:
raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Item not found")
item = data[item_id]
if item["owner"] != username:
raise OwnerError(username)
return item
Before FastAPI 0.106.0, raising exceptions after yield
was not possible, the exit code in dependencies with yield
was executed after the response was sent, so Exception Handlers would have already run.
This was designed this way mainly to allow using the same objects "yielded" by dependencies inside of background tasks, because the exit code would be executed after the background tasks were finished.
Nevertheless, as this would mean waiting for the response to travel through the network while unnecessarily holding a resource in a dependency with yield (for example a database connection), this was changed in FastAPI 0.106.0.
Additionally, a background task is normally an independent set of logic that should be handled separately, with its own resources (e.g. its own database connection).
If you used to rely on this behavior, now you should create the resources for background tasks inside the background task itself, and use internally only data that doesn't depend on the resources of dependencies with yield
.
For example, instead of using the same database session, you would create a new database session inside of the background task, and you would obtain the objects from the database using this new session. And then instead of passing the object from the database as a parameter to the background task function, you would pass the ID of that object and then obtain the object again inside the background task function.
The sequence of execution before FastAPI 0.106.0 was like this diagram:
Time flows from top to bottom. And each column is one of the parts interacting or executing code.
sequenceDiagram
participant client as Client
participant handler as Exception handler
participant dep as Dep with yield
participant operation as Path Operation
participant tasks as Background tasks
Note over client,tasks: Can raise exception for dependency, handled after response is sent
Note over client,operation: Can raise HTTPException and can change the response
client ->> dep: Start request
Note over dep: Run code up to yield
opt raise
dep -->> handler: Raise HTTPException
handler -->> client: HTTP error response
dep -->> dep: Raise other exception
end
dep ->> operation: Run dependency, e.g. DB session
opt raise
operation -->> dep: Raise HTTPException
dep -->> handler: Auto forward exception
handler -->> client: HTTP error response
operation -->> dep: Raise other exception
dep -->> handler: Auto forward exception
end
operation ->> client: Return response to client
Note over client,operation: Response is already sent, can't change it anymore
opt Tasks
operation -->> tasks: Send background tasks
end
opt Raise other exception
tasks -->> dep: Raise other exception
end
Note over dep: After yield
opt Handle other exception
dep -->> dep: Handle exception, can't change response. E.g. close DB session.
end
The new execution flow can be found in the docs: Execution of dependencies with yield
.

0.100.0 (2023-07-07)¶
✨ Support for Pydantic v2 ✨
Pydantic version 2 has the core re-written in Rust and includes a lot of improvements and features, for example:
- Improved correctness in corner cases.
- Safer types.
- Better performance and less energy consumption.
- Better extensibility.
- etc.
...all this while keeping the same Python API. In most of the cases, for simple models, you can simply upgrade the Pydantic version and get all the benefits. 🚀
In some cases, for pure data validation and processing, you can get performance improvements of 20x or more. This means 2,000% or more. 🤯
When you use FastAPI, there's a lot more going on, processing the request and response, handling dependencies, executing your own code, and particularly, waiting for the network. But you will probably still get some nice performance improvements just from the upgrade.
The focus of this release is compatibility with Pydantic v1 and v2, to make sure your current apps keep working. Later there will be more focus on refactors, correctness, code improvements, and then performance improvements. Some third-party early beta testers that ran benchmarks on the beta releases of FastAPI reported improvements of 2x - 3x. Which is not bad for just doing pip install --upgrade fastapi pydantic
. This was not an official benchmark and I didn't check it myself, but it's a good sign.
Migration¶
Check out the Pydantic migration guide.
For the things that need changes in your Pydantic models, the Pydantic team built bump-pydantic
.
A command line tool that will process your code and update most of the things automatically for you. Make sure you have your code in git first, and review each of the changes to make sure everything is correct before committing the changes.
Pydantic v1¶
This version of FastAPI still supports Pydantic v1. And although Pydantic v1 will be deprecated at some point, it will still be supported for a while.
This means that you can install the new Pydantic v2, and if something fails, you can install Pydantic v1 while you fix any problems you might have, but having the latest FastAPI.
There are tests for both Pydantic v1 and v2, and test coverage is kept at 100%.
Changes¶
-
There are new parameter fields supported by Pydantic
Field()
for:Path()
Query()
Header()
Cookie()
Body()
Form()
File()
-
The new parameter fields are:
default_factory
alias_priority
validation_alias
serialization_alias
discriminator
strict
multiple_of
allow_inf_nan
max_digits
decimal_places
json_schema_extra
...you can read about them in the Pydantic docs.
- The parameter
regex
has been deprecated and replaced bypattern
.- You can read more about it in the docs for Query Parameters and String Validations: Add regular expressions.
- New Pydantic models use an improved and simplified attribute
model_config
that takes a simple dict instead of an internal classConfig
for their configuration.- You can read more about it in the docs for Declare Request Example Data.
- The attribute
schema_extra
for the internal classConfig
has been replaced by the keyjson_schema_extra
in the newmodel_config
dict.- You can read more about it in the docs for Declare Request Example Data.
- When you install
"fastapi[all]"
it now also includes:pydantic-settings
- for settings management.pydantic-extra-types
- for extra types to be used with Pydantic.
-
Now Pydantic Settings is an additional optional package (included in
"fastapi[all]"
). To use settings you should now importfrom pydantic_settings import BaseSettings
instead of importing frompydantic
directly.- You can read more about it in the docs for Settings and Environment Variables.

0.95.0 (2023-03-18)¶
Highlights¶
This release adds support for dependencies and parameters using Annotated
and recommends its usage. ✨
This has several benefits, one of the main ones is that now the parameters of your functions with Annotated
would not be affected at all.
If you call those functions in other places in your code, the actual default values will be kept, your editor will help you notice missing required arguments, Python will require you to pass required arguments at runtime, you will be able to use the same functions for different things and with different libraries (e.g. Typer will soon support Annotated
too, then you could use the same function for an API and a CLI), etc.
Because Annotated
is standard Python, you still get all the benefits from editors and tools, like autocompletion, inline errors, etc.
One of the biggest benefits is that now you can create Annotated
dependencies that are then shared by multiple path operation functions, this will allow you to reduce a lot of code duplication in your codebase, while keeping all the support from editors and tools.
For example, you could have code like this:
def get_current_user(token: str):
# authenticate user
return User()
@app.get("/items/")
def read_items(user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
...
@app.post("/items/")
def create_item(*, user: User = Depends(get_current_user), item: Item):
...
@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(*, user: User = Depends(get_current_user), item_id: int):
...
@app.delete("/items/{item_id}")
def delete_item(*, user: User = Depends(get_current_user), item_id: int):
...
There's a bit of code duplication for the dependency:
user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
...the bigger the codebase, the more noticeable it is.
Now you can create an annotated dependency once, like this:
CurrentUser = Annotated[User, Depends(get_current_user)]
And then you can reuse this Annotated
dependency:
CurrentUser = Annotated[User, Depends(get_current_user)]
@app.get("/items/")
def read_items(user: CurrentUser):
...
@app.post("/items/")
def create_item(user: CurrentUser, item: Item):
...
@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(user: CurrentUser, item_id: int):
...
@app.delete("/items/{item_id}")
def delete_item(user: CurrentUser, item_id: int):
...
...and CurrentUser
has all the typing information as User
, so your editor will work as expected (autocompletion and everything), and FastAPI will be able to understand the dependency defined in Annotated
. 😎
Roughly all the docs have been rewritten to use Annotated
as the main way to declare parameters and dependencies. All the examples in the docs now include a version with Annotated
and a version without it, for each of the specific Python versions (when there are small differences/improvements in more recent versions). There were around 23K new lines added between docs, examples, and tests. 🚀
The key updated docs are:
- Python Types Intro:
- Tutorial:
Special thanks to @nzig for the core implementation and to @adriangb for the inspiration and idea with Xpresso! 🚀

0.93.0 (2023-03-07)¶
Features¶
- ✨ Add support for
lifespan
async context managers (supersedingstartup
andshutdown
events). Initial PR #2944 by @uSpike.
Now, instead of using independent startup
and shutdown
events, you can define that logic in a single function with yield
decorated with @asynccontextmanager
(an async context manager).
For example:
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from fastapi import FastAPI
def fake_answer_to_everything_ml_model(x: float):
return x * 42
ml_models = {}
@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
# Load the ML model
ml_models["answer_to_everything"] = fake_answer_to_everything_ml_model
yield
# Clean up the ML models and release the resources
ml_models.clear()
app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)
@app.get("/predict")
async def predict(x: float):
result = ml_models["answer_to_everything"](x)
return {"result": result}
Note: This is the recommended way going forward, instead of using startup
and shutdown
events.
Read more about it in the new docs: Advanced User Guide: Lifespan Events.

0.92.0 (2023-02-14)¶
🚨 This is a security fix. Please upgrade as soon as possible.
Upgrades¶
- ⬆️ Upgrade Starlette to 0.25.0. PR #5996 by @tiangolo.
- This solves a vulnerability that could allow denial of service attacks by using many small multipart fields/files (parts), consuming high CPU and memory.
- Only applications using forms (e.g. file uploads) could be affected.
- For most cases, upgrading won't have any breaking changes.
0.91.0 (2023-02-10)¶
Upgrades¶
- ⬆️ Upgrade Starlette version to
0.24.0
and refactor internals for compatibility. PR #5985 by @tiangolo.- This can solve nuanced errors when using middlewares. Before Starlette
0.24.0
, a new instance of each middleware class would be created when a new middleware was added. That normally was not a problem, unless the middleware class expected to be created only once, with only one instance, that happened in some cases. This upgrade would solve those cases (thanks @adriangb! Starlette PR #2017). Now the middleware class instances are created once, right before the first request (the first time the app is called). - If you depended on that previous behavior, you might need to update your code. As always, make sure your tests pass before merging the upgrade.

0.89.0 (2023-01-07)¶
Features¶
- ✨ Add support for function return type annotations to declare the
response_model
. Initial PR #1436 by @uriyyo.
Now you can declare the return type / response_model
in the function return type annotation:
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
app = FastAPI()
class Item(BaseModel):
name: str
price: float
@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items() -> list[Item]:
return [
Item(name="Portal Gun", price=42.0),
Item(name="Plumbus", price=32.0),
]
FastAPI will use the return type annotation to perform:
- Data validation
- Automatic documentation
- It could power automatic client generators
- Data filtering
Before this version it was only supported via the response_model
parameter.
Read more about it in the new docs: Response Model - Return Type.

0.80.0 (2022-08-23)¶
Breaking Changes - Fixes¶
If you are using response_model
with some type that doesn't include None
but the function is returning None
, it will now raise an internal server error, because you are returning invalid data that violates the contract in response_model
. Before this release it would allow breaking that contract returning None
.
For example, if you have an app like this:
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
class Item(BaseModel):
name: str
price: Optional[float] = None
owner_ids: Optional[List[int]] = None
app = FastAPI()
@app.get("/items/invalidnone", response_model=Item)
def get_invalid_none():
return None
...calling the path /items/invalidnone
will raise an error, because None
is not a valid type for the response_model
declared with Item
.
You could also be implicitly returning None
without realizing, for example:
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
class Item(BaseModel):
name: str
price: Optional[float] = None
owner_ids: Optional[List[int]] = None
app = FastAPI()
@app.get("/items/invalidnone", response_model=Item)
def get_invalid_none():
if flag:
return {"name": "foo"}
# if flag is False, at this point the function will implicitly return None
If you have path operations using response_model
that need to be allowed to return None
, make it explicit in response_model
using Union[Something, None]
:
from typing import Union
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
class Item(BaseModel):
name: str
price: Optional[float] = None
owner_ids: Optional[List[int]] = None
app = FastAPI()
@app.get("/items/invalidnone", response_model=Union[Item, None])
def get_invalid_none():
return None
This way the data will be correctly validated, you won't have an internal server error, and the documentation will also reflect that this path operation could return None
(or null
in JSON).

0.78.0 (2022-05-14)¶
Features¶
-
✨ Add support for omitting
...
as default value when declaring required parameters with: -
Path()
Query()
Header()
Cookie()
Body()
Form()
File()
New docs at Tutorial - Query Parameters and String Validations - Make it required. PR #4906 by @tiangolo.
Up to now, declaring a required parameter while adding additional validation or metadata needed using ...
(Ellipsis).
For example:
from fastapi import Cookie, FastAPI, Header, Path, Query
app = FastAPI()
@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def main(
item_id: int = Path(default=..., gt=0),
query: str = Query(default=..., max_length=10),
session: str = Cookie(default=..., min_length=3),
x_trace: str = Header(default=..., title="Tracing header"),
):
return {"message": "Hello World"}
...all these parameters are required because the default value is ...
(Ellipsis).
But now it's possible and supported to just omit the default value, as would be done with Pydantic fields, and the parameters would still be required.
✨ For example, this is now supported:
from fastapi import Cookie, FastAPI, Header, Path, Query
app = FastAPI()
@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def main(
item_id: int = Path(gt=0),
query: str = Query(max_length=10),
session: str = Cookie(min_length=3),
x_trace: str = Header(title="Tracing header"),
):
return {"message": "Hello World"}
To declare parameters as optional (not required), you can set a default value as always, for example using None
:
from typing import Union
from fastapi import Cookie, FastAPI, Header, Path, Query
app = FastAPI()
@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def main(
item_id: int = Path(gt=0),
query: Union[str, None] = Query(default=None, max_length=10),
session: Union[str, None] = Cookie(default=None, min_length=3),
x_trace: Union[str, None] = Header(default=None, title="Tracing header"),
):
return {"message": "Hello World"}

0.74.0 (2022-02-17)¶
Breaking Changes¶
Dependencies with yield
can now catch HTTPException
and custom exceptions. For example:
async def get_database():
with Session() as session:
try:
yield session
except HTTPException:
session.rollback()
raise
finally:
session.close()
After the dependency with yield
handles the exception (or not) the exception is raised again. So that any exception handlers can catch it, or ultimately the default internal ServerErrorMiddleware
.
If you depended on exceptions not being received by dependencies with yield
, and receiving an exception breaks the code after yield
, you can use a block with try
and finally
:
async def do_something():
try:
yield something
finally:
some_cleanup()
...that way the finally
block is run regardless of any exception that might happen.
Features¶
- The same PR #4575 from above also fixes the
contextvars
context for the code before and afteryield
. This was the main objective of that PR.
This means that now, if you set a value in a context variable before yield
, the value would still be available after yield
(as you would intuitively expect). And it also means that you can reset the context variable with a token afterwards.
For example, this works correctly now:
from contextvars import ContextVar
from typing import Any, Dict, Optional
legacy_request_state_context_var: ContextVar[Optional[Dict[str, Any]]] = ContextVar(
"legacy_request_state_context_var", default=None
)
async def set_up_request_state_dependency():
request_state = {"user": "deadpond"}
contextvar_token = legacy_request_state_context_var.set(request_state)
yield request_state
legacy_request_state_context_var.reset(contextvar_token)
...before this change it would raise an error when resetting the context variable, because the contextvars
context was different, because of the way it was implemented.
Note: You probably don't need contextvars
, and you should probably avoid using them. But they are powerful and useful in some advanced scenarios, for example, migrating from code that used Flask's g
semi-global variable.

0.70.0 (2021-10-07)¶
This release just upgrades Starlette to the latest version, 0.16.0
, which includes several bug fixes and some small breaking changes.
These last three consecutive releases are independent so that you can migrate gradually:
- First to FastAPI
0.68.2
, with no breaking changes, but upgrading all the sub-dependencies. - Next to FastAPI
0.69.0
, which upgrades Starlette to0.15.0
, with AnyIO support, and a higher chance of having breaking changes in your code. - Finally to FastAPI
0.70.0
, just upgrading Starlette to the latest version0.16.0
with additional bug fixes.
This way, in case there was a breaking change for your code in one of the releases, you can still benefit from the previous upgrades. ✨
Breaking Changes - Upgrade¶
Also upgrades the ranges of optional dependencies:
"jinja2 >=2.11.2,<4.0.0"
"itsdangerous >=1.1.0,<3.0.0"
0.69.0 (2021-10-07)¶
Breaking Changes - Upgrade¶
This release adds support for Trio. ✨
It upgrades the version of Starlette to 0.15.0
, now based on AnyIO, and the internal async components in FastAPI are now based on AnyIO as well, making it compatible with both asyncio and Trio.
You can read the docs about running FastAPI with Trio using Hypercorn.
This release also removes graphene
as an optional dependency for GraphQL. If you need to work with GraphQL, the recommended library now is Strawberry. You can read the new FastAPI with GraphQL docs.

This release has no breaking changes. 🎉
It upgrades the version ranges of sub-dependencies to allow applications using FastAPI to easily upgrade them.

0.65.2 (2021-06-09)¶
Security fixes¶
- 🔒 Check Content-Type request header before assuming JSON. Initial PR #2118 by @patrickkwang.
This change fixes a CSRF security vulnerability when using cookies for authentication in path operations with JSON payloads sent by browsers.
In versions lower than 0.65.2
, FastAPI would try to read the request payload as JSON even if the content-type
header sent was not set to application/json
or a compatible JSON media type (e.g. application/geo+json
).
So, a request with a content type of text/plain
containing JSON data would be accepted and the JSON data would be extracted.
But requests with content type text/plain
are exempt from CORS preflights, for being considered Simple requests. So, the browser would execute them right away including cookies, and the text content could be a JSON string that would be parsed and accepted by the FastAPI application.
See CVE-2021-32677 for more details.

0.62.0 (2020-11-29)¶
Features¶
Up to now, for several options, the only way to apply them to a group of path operations was in include_router
. That works well, but the call to app.include_router()
or router.include_router()
is normally done in another file.
That means that, for example, to apply authentication to all the path operations in a router it would end up being done in a different file, instead of keeping related logic together.
Setting options in include_router
still makes sense in some cases, for example, to override or increase configurations from a third party router included in an app. But in a router that is part of a bigger application, it would probably make more sense to add those settings when creating the APIRouter
.
In FastAPI
This allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters):
default_response_class
: updated to handle defaults inAPIRouter
andinclude_router
.dependencies
: to include ✨ top-level dependencies ✨ that apply to the whole application. E.g. to add global authentication.callbacks
: OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the path operations.deprecated
: to mark all the path operations as deprecated. 🤷include_in_schema
: to allow excluding all the path operations from the OpenAPI schema.responses
: OpenAPI responses that apply to all the path operations.
For example:
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
async def some_dependency():
return
app = FastAPI(dependencies=[Depends(some_dependency)])
In APIRouter
This allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters):
default_response_class
: updated to handle defaults inAPIRouter
andinclude_router
. For example, it's not needed to set it explicitly when creating callbacks.dependencies
: to include ✨ router-level dependencies ✨ that apply to all the path operations in a router. Up to now, this was only possible withinclude_router
.callbacks
: OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the path operations in this router.deprecated
: to mark all the path operations in a router as deprecated.include_in_schema
: to allow excluding all the path operations in a router from the OpenAPI schema.responses
: OpenAPI responses that apply to all the path operations in a router.prefix
: to set the path prefix for a router. Up to now, this was only possible when callinginclude_router
.tags
: OpenAPI tags to apply to all the path operations in this router.
For example:
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends
async def some_dependency():
return
router = APIRouter(prefix="/users", dependencies=[Depends(some_dependency)])
In include_router
Most of these settings are now supported in APIRouter
, which normally lives closer to the related code, so it is recommended to use APIRouter
when possible.
But include_router
is still useful to, for example, adding options (like dependencies
, prefix
, and tags
) when including a third party router, or a generic router that is shared between several projects.
This PR allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters):
default_response_class
: updated to handle defaults inAPIRouter
andFastAPI
.deprecated
: to mark all the path operations in a router as deprecated in OpenAPI.include_in_schema
: to allow disabling all the path operations from showing in the OpenAPI schema.callbacks
: OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the path operations in this router.
Note: all the previous parameters are still there, so it's still possible to declare dependencies
in include_router
.
Breaking Changes¶
- PR #2434 includes several improvements that shouldn't affect normal use cases, but could affect in advanced scenarios:
- If you are testing the generated OpenAPI (you shouldn't, FastAPI already tests it extensively for you): the order for
tags
ininclude_router
and path operations was updated for consistency, but it's a simple order change. - If you have advanced custom logic to access each route's
route.response_class
, or therouter.default_response_class
, or theapp.default_response_class
: the default value forresponse_class
inAPIRoute
and fordefault_response_class
inAPIRouter
andFastAPI
is now aDefaultPlaceholder
used internally to handle and solve default values and overrides. The actual response class inside theDefaultPlaceholder
is available atroute.response_class.value
.
- If you are testing the generated OpenAPI (you shouldn't, FastAPI already tests it extensively for you): the order for

Fix OpenAPI/JSON Schema generation for two functions with the same name (in different modules) with the same composite bodies.
- Composite bodies' IDs are now based on path, not only on route name, as the auto-generated name uses the function names, that can be duplicated in different modules.
- The same new ID generation applies to response models.
- This also changes the generated title for those models.
- Only composite bodies and response models are affected because those are generated dynamically, they don't have a module (a Python file).
- This also adds the possibility of using
.include_router()
with the sameAPIRouter
multiple times, with different prefixes, e.g./api/v2
and/api/latest
, and it will now work correctly. - PR #347.

0.30.0 (2019-06-20)¶
-
Add support for Pydantic's ORM mode:
- Updated documentation about SQL with SQLAlchemy, using Pydantic models with ORM mode, SQLAlchemy models with relations, separation of files, simplification of code and other changes. New docs: SQL (Relational) Databases.
- The new support for ORM mode fixes issues/adds features related to ORMs with lazy-loading, hybrid properties, dynamic/getters (using
@property
decorators) and several other use cases. - This applies to ORMs like SQLAlchemy, Peewee, Tortoise ORM, GINO ORM and virtually any other.
- If your path operations return an arbitrary object with attributes (e.g.
my_item.name
instead ofmy_item["name"]
) AND you use aresponse_model
, make sure to update the Pydantic models withorm_mode = True
as described in the docs (link above). - New documentation about receiving plain
dict
s as request bodies: Bodies of arbitrarydict
s. - New documentation about returning arbitrary
dict
s in responses: Response with arbitrarydict
. - Technical Details:
- When declaring a
response_model
it is used directly to generate the response content, from whatever was returned from the path operation function. - Before this, the return content was first passed through
jsonable_encoder
to ensure it was a "jsonable" object, like adict
, instead of an arbitrary object with attributes (like an ORM model). That's why you should make sure to update your Pydantic models for objects with attributes to useorm_mode = True
. - If you don't have a
response_model
, the return object will still be passed throughjsonable_encoder
first. - When a
response_model
is declared, the sameresponse_model
type declaration won't be used as is, it will be "cloned" to create an new one (a cloned PydanticField
with all the submodels cloned as well). - This avoids/fixes a potential security issue: as the returned object is passed directly to Pydantic, if the returned object was a subclass of the
response_model
(e.g. you return aUserInDB
that inherits fromUser
but contains extra fields, likehashed_password
, andUser
is used in theresponse_model
), it would still pass the validation (becauseUserInDB
is a subclass ofUser
) and the object would be returned as-is, including thehashed_password
. To fix this, the declaredresponse_model
is cloned, if it is a Pydantic model class (or contains Pydantic model classes in it, e.g. in aList[Item]
), the Pydantic model class(es) will be a different one (the "cloned" one). So, an object that is a subclass won't simply pass the validation and returned as-is, because it is no longer a sub-class of the clonedresponse_model
. Instead, a new Pydantic model object will be created with the contents of the returned object. So, it will be a new object (made with the data from the returned one), and will be filtered by the clonedresponse_model
, containing only the declared fields as normally.

0.28.0 (2019-06-05)¶
-
Implement dependency cache per request.
- This avoids calling each dependency multiple times for the same request.
- This is useful while calling external services, performing costly computation, etc.
- This also means that if a dependency was declared as a path operation decorator dependency, possibly at the router level (with
.include_router()
) and then it is declared again in a specific path operation, the dependency will be called only once. - The cache can be disabled per dependency declaration, using
use_cache=False
as inDepends(your_dependency, use_cache=False)
. - Updated docs at: Using the same dependency multiple times.

Add OAuth2 redirect page for Swagger UI. This allows having delegated authentication in the Swagger UI docs. For this to work, you need to add

http://localhost:8000/docs/oauth2-redirect
. - Keep in mind that this callback URL is independent of whichever one is used by your frontend. You might also have another callback at
https://yourdomain.com/login/callback

Add support for
dependencies
parameter:- A parameter in path operation decorators, for dependencies that should be executed but the return value is not important or not used in the path operation function.
- A parameter in the
.include_router()
method of FastAPI applications and routers, to include dependencies that should be executed in each path operation in a router.- This is useful, for example, to require authentication or permissions in specific group of path operations.
- Different
dependencies
can be applied to different routers.
- These
dependencies
are run before the normal parameter dependencies. And normal dependencies are run too. They can be combined. - Dependencies declared in a router are executed first, then the ones defined in path operation decorators, and then the ones declared in normal parameters. They are all combined and executed.
- All this also supports using
